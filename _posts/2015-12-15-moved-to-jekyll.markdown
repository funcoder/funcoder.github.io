summary: Time for change, time for Jekyll
---

A lot off fellow developers have moved to staticly generated sites for their 
blogs. So I thought it was time to move to something only a coder would love
rather than a bloated Wordpress site. Thanks to Rob Conery for his Pluralsight
course called **Web Applications Without a Server** which hooked me in on using
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
